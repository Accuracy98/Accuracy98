## Hi, I'm Accuracy98. 
The meaning of this name is that I hope my accuracy can be higher. I was born in 1998 :grinning:. Even if it cannot reach 100, I aim for 98. You can call me **Chris** ; it's my preferred name.  
I'm a Computer Science graduate student actively looking for internship or job opportunities.
