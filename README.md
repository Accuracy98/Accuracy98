## Hi, I'm Accuracy98. 
The meaning behind my name is my desire for enhanced accuracy. I was born in 1998, and to prevent potential duplicates, I've included my birth year 😀 . Another goal of mine is to achieve a precision level of 98, even if it falls short of 100. Feel free to call me Chris; that's my preferred name.
  
I'm a Computer Science graduate student actively looking for internship or job opportunities.
